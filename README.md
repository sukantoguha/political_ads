# Political Ad Analysis
### Databases project which analyzes political advertisements

Advertising is an important part of politics in the real world, often influencing elections and voter thoughts. This has become more and more prevalent in recent times, as there have been increasingly sophisticated campaigns targeting populations. My motivation was to apply what Iâ€™ve learnt in Database Systems to create an application which would show some interesting trends in online advertising spends in the political domain.

I looked for real-world data which would enable the user to form interesting analysis. I obtained such data from this [Google Political Ad Transparency dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/transparency-report/google-political-ads?filter=solution-type:dataset&id=0c422e45-5809-4373-b2f4-ce31204c2f4c). I had to extract the data into csv files and then import it into my local sql instance. 

I created a Netbeans GUI in Java for this application, the code for which can be found in the political_ads folder, within the Home.java file.
